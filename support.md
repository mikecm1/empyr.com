### Example FAQs

## What is a Card Linked Offers Program?

A Card Linked Offers Program is a discreet rewards program that gives you cash back at your favorite businesses. All you have to do is link your credit/debit card, choose your favorite location on the program, activate the offer and enjoy! Due to our official partnership with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, your cash reward is credited automatically back to your card. No hassling with coupons or loyalty cards; it is for everyone!

## Is the program free? Does it cost anything?

This program is totally free! Members will never be charged anything to participate. In fact, we only have the ability to credit money to your account, not take money out of it!

## How do I join?

What?! You're saying you aren't a member of the Mogl family yet? Well don't you worry because joining Mogl only takes a minute!

1. Go to www.mogl.com or download our mobile app available on both Android and iOS.
2. Create a username and password.
3. Add your credit/debit card and tada!! You're an official Mogl'er!
4. Find participating businesses near you and start earning your cash back!

## How much cash back can I get?

Businesses can give you as much cash back as they desire but most are limited at $250 per transaction. Make sure that you're using a card that's accepted at the business! Double check the accepted cards at the bottom of the business' profile page.

To see how much cash back is being given at a particular location during the time of your visit, please check the business' page on our site or app and then activate that offer.

What you need to know:

* You'll ALWAYS earn cash back, just the amount will vary
* The BEST offers are listed FIRST in the app and website
* The cash back is based off of your subtotaled bill before tip

## Can I order through a delivery service or order online?

**ANY** third-party ordering services and delivery companies **(for example: Square, Grubhub, Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Clover, Postmates etc.)** are not eligible for cash back or promotions. The purchase must be made through the business' credit card machine.

If you are ordering at a participating business online, please note that most use  **external ** resources to facilitate the online ordering. If you are entering your credit/debit card online, please call the business to make sure that they run their online orders through their credit card machine. If they do not run them through the credit card machine, you will not receive cash back or cash rewards.

## What is my "Primary" Card?

The primary card is the card where you will receive the cash back and cash reward payout. You will receive this payment around the 20th monthly (as long as you've reached the $10 minimum in the previous month).

**Can I only earn cash back on my primary card?**

No way! Any card that you register on the program will earn you cash back at a participating business. All you have to do is use your card as credit!

**So, what is the difference between my primary card and my other cards?**

We're glad you asked! Any card registered on the program can help you receive cash back at participating businesses. However, only your primary card can receive the monthly deposits. So as long as your primary card is an active credit card, you'll successfully receive your payouts!

## Where can I view my cash back history?

We like to see users taking advantage of all of their resources, so we're glad you asked!

Go to your **Profile** in the top right-hand side of the page and click to the drop-down menu. On the main page you'll see **Cash Back** underneath to the left-hand side of your name. Click on that and you'll see the cash back history pop up. If you can't scroll through the entire history, simply use your up and down arrows to navigate.

If you notice you're missing a transaction, don't worry! Simply email our awesome Customer Support team at support@mogl.com with your receipt and your account email address.

## How long does it take for a purchase to show up?

**We know how excited you are to get your cash back, so we do our best to have transactions show up as soon as possible! Earnings may take anywhere from a few minutes to 5 days to show up, depending on the type of card used and business visited.**

**Most Visa transactions come through within 10 minutes after purchase is made. Be sure to download our Mogl app to get a real time notification of your purchases.**

**Amex and MasterCard transactions can take up to 3-5 days to show up.**

On a rare occasion, earnings may not show up in your Mogl account. First, check out the payment methods on the business profile page to make sure the type of card (Amex, Visa, MC) you used is supported by the business. If it is accepted and it's been longer than 5 days, please email our amazing support department at support@mogl.com so we can get you the cash back you deserve! Please include your receipt or processing information. It's helpful if you have a receipt or processing information from the business as well as your Mogl account email. We'll contact you shortly!

## My account is missing a transaction!

Oh no! We understand how frustrating this can be, so please understand that we will work with you to make sure that we're doing whatever it takes to get to the bottom of the issue! Please read the following information and see if it relates to your transaction:

* Cards must be registered before the purchase is made in order to be eligible for cash back or rewards.
* Not all credit cards are accepted at every participating business, so please review the business' profile page before swiping your card!
* Third party ordering services such as Grubhub, Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Square, etc. are not eligible for cash back or promotions. If you have any doubt, please contact the business to make sure that your order will be processed through their credit card machine in the business.
* Businesses on the program are always changing, so make sure to check that the business is still participating.
* You need to run all transactions as credit even when using your debit card. If you are entering your pin, we will not be able to track the transaction.
* Most businesses participate in "click-to-activate offers". This means you need to click on the offer in order to activate it before each purchase. Please make sure to look at the offer beforehand to ensure you receive your cash back!

In the event that your transaction does not fall under any of these circumstances, please note that some earnings can take 3-5 days from the date of purchase to show up on the site. This time delay can be due to business running their credit card reports at different points during the week.

If you do not see your purchase within 5 days of the transaction, please [email us](http://www.cashbackhelp.com/customer/portal/emails/new) about all purchases you made that didn't get credited to your account. If the transaction occurred more than 60 days before contacting us, then we will not be able to credit your account so please make sure to contact us as soon as you realize something is wrong. It's important to have a receipt or processing information from the business to ensure a registered card was used as well as your Mogl account email. We'll contact you shortly!

## How & when do I get paid?

Great question! First, make sure your primary card is updated to reflect your most recent and up to date credit card. Next, make sure that you've earned over $10.00 in your account. Once you have an updated primary card and over $10.00 in your account, the money will be deposited back onto your card around the 20th of the following month. (i.e.: Your total May earnings will be deposited onto your card around June 20th).

**What's the difference between cash back, cash rewards, and jackpot earnings?**

* **Cash back:** This is the money you earn when you use your card at a participating business. Example: Eric's Pizza is offering 10% cash back. When you activate the offer and then use your registered credit/debit card at Eric's Pizza, 10% of your subtotaled bill will be credited back to your account balance.
* **Cash Rewards:** When you email [support@mogl.com](mailto:support@mogl.com) due to a transaction issue, the money that the support department issues to your account will show up in your account balance. This money is given manually by the amazing support team! **It is also important to note that all other types of earnings (jackpot and promotional earnings) will show up in your cash reward thermometer.** The only money that does not show up in your cash rewards thermometer is the cash back you earn automatically.
* **Jackpot Earnings:** If you are one of the top spenders at a participating business (make sure to check their page to see if they're offering a jackpot) by the 8th of the following month, you will earn the jackpot prize! The different jackpots can range from $1.00 to $30.00, so make sure to check the profile page to see how much you can earn!

Some more important information:

* Once you reach a $10 account balance, you are eligible for a monthly payment. Payments submitted to the primary card on file on the 8th of the month and usually take 2 weeks to process.
* If you received an email indicating a payment, please check your bank statement around the 20th of that month.
* **Cancelled Cards** : If the card you have on file was cancelled, please contact us as the payment may have failed to be completed and we will work with you on getting this resolved.
* If your account is completely closed, please contact your former bank.

## Ineligible transaction - fulfilled by another program.

While some businesses participate in multiple rewards programs, customers are only eligible to earn rewards through one program a business uses. Although you may have received a cash back notification, the cash back dropped from your account because it was blocked by another rewards program linked to the card you used.

In order to start receiving cash back through Mogl again (cash back directly on your card, rather than miles or points), add another card that is not linked to any other program, or  **remove your card**  from other rewards programs:

## Click-to-Activate Offers

Most businesses are now participating in what we call click-to-activate or CTA offers. This means that you as a user need to activate the offer on the businesses profile page before each separate transaction in order to ensure you receive the cash back reward. The great thing about these new offers is that we reward our engaged users by offering higher cash back percentages!

If you activated the offer and then made your purchase at a participating business but did not receive your cash back notification, please contact our Customer Support team at [support@mogl.com](mailto:support@mogl.com). We will look into this matter and get things resolved for you!

## I'm new to this program, is there anything I should know?

Though we recommend that you read all of the FAQ's, here are some of the main things you should know:

* Not all credit cards are accepted at every participating business, so please review the business' profile page before swiping your card!
* You need to earn a total of $10.00 (between your cash back and cash reward thermometer) to get the deposit back onto your primary card!
* Third party ordering services such as Grubhub, Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Square, etc. are not eligible for cash back or promotions. If you have any doubt, please contact the business to make sure that your order will be processed through their credit card machine in the business.
* Tip is not included in the transaction amount.
* Cards must be registered before the purchase is made in order to be eligible for cash back or rewards.
* Businesses on the program are always changing, so make sure to check what new businesses we've added near you!
* You need to run all transactions as credit even when using your debit card. If you are entering your pin, we will not be able to track the transaction.
* Most businesses participate in "click-to-activate offers". This means you need to click on the offer in order to activate it before each purchase. Please make sure to look at the offer beforehand to ensure you receive your cash back!
* If a missing transaction occurred more than 60 days before contacting us, then we will not be able to credit your account so please make sure to contact us as soon as you realize something is wrong.

## Is your site secure?

We know giving out personal information and credit card numbers makes everyone uneasy. Recognizing this, we've implemented bank level encryption to secure your log in credentials, which cannot be compromised. These include:

* VeriSignÂ® certified (Internet Security Global Leader)
* VisaÂ® certified third-party processor (TPP)
* American ExpressÂ® Certified end-point processor
* Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant
* 128-bit SSL encryption
* Secure user password authentication
* MD5 encryption for card protection

Plus, as a general policy

* Consumers can choose to remain completely anonymous
* Your information will never be shared

## Why do you need my card details?

First off, we use bank level encryption to secure that your log in credentials cannot be compromised.

By securely registering your debit or credit cards with us, we are able to track your transactions at our participating businesses. We do this in association with Visa, Master Card, and American Express. After the transaction occurs, the card provider notifies us of the purchase amount, and we credit your account with the cash back.

We only have the ability to credit money to your account, not take money out of it. We're givers, not takers.

## I forgot my password!

Go to this link: [https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password](https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password) and type in your login email address. You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password within 15 minutes. The email will be from noreply@ymail.mogl.com. Please make sure to check your junk/spam folders if you don't receive the email!

In the event that you are locked out of your account, please wait up to two hours before trying to log back in.

## How do I change my email address?

Changing your email address on Mogl is super easy! Go to your profile settings here: [https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings). Select **My Account** on the left-hand side of the page, scroll down to where it says **Change Emai** l and enter your updated email address.

## How do I add a credit card?

To add a credit card to your Mogl account, please go to your **Settings** here: [https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings)

Scroll down and click **Cards** on the left-hand side of the page. Once you're on the **Cards** page, scroll down until you see **Link New Card**. Go ahead and type out your card number into the box.

You will be able to earn cash back on any card that is registered with Mogl, but you will need to designate a primary card. This primary card will be used to credit your bank account when you have earned a Mogl payday.

â€‹Also, please keep in mind that all businesses do not accept every credit card for Mogl purchases. To ensure you have a great Mogl experience, please check the business' profile page to see if your card is accepted! Visa is accepted at all Mogl locations.

## How many Debit/Credit Cards can I sign up?

We like your thinking!  You want to register all your cards to make sure you don't miss out on any earnings, are we right?! So, go ahead and register as many as you like, we have no limit!

## How do I unsubscribe from your emails?

Drowning in too many emails? We're sorry to hear that! In order to unsubscribe from Mogl emails, follow the steps below:

1. Login to your Mogl profile and go to the top right corner of the page.
2. From the drop-down menu, click **Settings**.
3. Click **Notifications** on the left-hand side of the page and scroll down until you see **Email Settings**. Uncheck the boxes for the emails you would not like to receive.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

**or** email support@mogl.com and ask to be unsubscribed or your account deactivated.

## What happens if my credit card expires or gets canceled?

Even if it has a different expiration number, we will still be able to track your purchases but you should delete the card and add it again if it is your primary card to ensure we have no issues completing a payment.

Here's what you do if your new card has a new number or is your primary card:

1. Login to your account and click **Settings**
2. Midway down the page you'll see **Credit Cards & Debit Cards**
3. Click **Delete Card**
4. Add an additional card by clicking **Add a Card**

If you need to change the card on which you want to be paid, this can be adjusted in your **Payment Preferences**. Just select your new card under "Pay me on this card"

Your new card must be registered in order to receive cash back rewards before the purchase is made.
