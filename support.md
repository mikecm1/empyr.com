  custom_markdown: "What is a Card Linked Offers Program?\n-----------------\nA Card
    Linked Offers Program is a discreet rewards program that gives you cash back at
    your favorite businesses. All you have to do is link your credit/debit card, choose
    your favorite location on the program, activate the offer and enjoy! Due to our
    official partnership with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, your cash reward
    is credited automatically back to your card. No hassling with coupons or loyalty
    cards; it is for everyone!\n\n\n+ Is the program free? Does it cost anything?\n-----------------\nThis
    program is totally free! Members will never be charged anything to participate.
    In fact, we only have the ability to credit money to your account, not take money
    out of it!\n\n\n+ How do I join?\n-----------------\nWhat?! You&#39;re saying
    you aren&#39;t a member of the Mogl family yet? Well don&#39;t you worry because
    joining Mogl only takes a minute!\n\n1. Go to www.mogl.com or download our mobile
    app available on both Android and iOS.\n2. Create a username and password.\n3.
    Add your credit/debit card and tada!! You&#39;re an official Mogl&#39;er!\n4.
    Find participating businesses near you and start earning your cash back!\n\n\n+
    How much cash back can I get?\n-----------------\nBusinesses can give you as much
    cash back as they desire but most are limited at $250 per transaction. Make sure
    that you&#39;re using a card that&#39;s accepted at the business! Double check
    the accepted cards at the bottom of the business&#39; profile page.\n\nTo see
    how much cash back is being given at a particular location during the time of
    your visit, please check the business&#39; page on our site or app and then activate
    that offer.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n- You&#39;ll ALWAYS earn cash back, just
    the amount will vary\n- The BEST offers are listed FIRST in the app and website\n-
    The cash back is based off of your subtotaled bill before tip\n\n\n+ Can I order
    through a delivery service or order online?\n-----------------\n**ANY** third-party
    ordering services and delivery companies **(for example: Square, Grubhub, Eat24,
    ChowNow, Groupon, Clover, Postmates etc.)** are not eligible for cash back or
    promotions. The purchase must be made through the business&#39; credit card machine.\n\nIf
    you are ordering at a participating business online, please note that most use
    \ **external ** resources to facilitate the online ordering. If you are entering
    your credit/debit card online, please call the business to make sure that they
    run their online orders through their credit card machine. If they do not run
    them through the credit card machine, you will not receive cash back or cash rewards.\n\n\n+
    What is my &quot;Primary&quot; Card?\n-----------------\nThe primary card is the
    card where you will receive the cash back and cash reward payout. You will receive
    this payment around the 20th monthly (as long as you&#39;ve reached the $10 minimum
    in the previous month).\n\n**Can I only earn cash back on my primary card?**\n\nNo
    way! Any card that you register on the program will earn you cash back at a participating
    business. All you have to do is use your card as credit!\n\n**So, what is the
    difference between my primary card and my other cards?**\n\nWe&#39;re glad you
    asked! Any card registered on the program can help you receive cash back at participating
    businesses. However, only your primary card can receive the monthly deposits.
    So as long as your primary card is an active credit card, you&#39;ll successfully
    receive your payouts!\n\n\n+ Where can I view my cash back history?\n-----------------\nWe
    like to see users taking advantage of all of their resources, so we&#39;re glad
    you asked!\n\nGo to your **Profile** in the top right-hand side of the page and
    click to the drop-down menu. On the main page you&#39;ll see **Cash Back** underneath
    to the left-hand side of your name. Click on that and you&#39;ll see the cash
    back history pop up. If you can&#39;t scroll through the entire history, simply
    use your up and down arrows to navigate.\n\nIf you notice you&#39;re missing a
    transaction, don&#39;t worry! Simply email our awesome Customer Support team at
    support@mogl.com with your receipt and your account email address.\n\n\n+ How
    long does it take for a purchase to show up?\n-----------------\n**We know how
    excited you are to get your cash back, so we do our best to have transactions
    show up as soon as possible! Earnings may take anywhere from a few minutes to
    5 days to show up, depending on the type of card used and business visited.**
    \ \n\n**Most Visa transactions come through within 10 minutes after purchase is
    made. Be sure to download our Mogl app to get a real time notification of your
    purchases.**\n\n**Amex and MasterCard transactions can take up to 3-5 days to
    show up.**\n\nOn a rare occasion, earnings may not show up in your Mogl account.
    First, check out the payment methods on the business profile page to make sure
    the type of card (Amex, Visa, MC) you used is supported by the business. If it
    is accepted and it&#39;s been longer than 5 days, please email our amazing support
    department at support@mogl.com so we can get you the cash back you deserve! Please
    include your receipt or processing information. It&#39;s helpful if you have a
    receipt or processing information from the business as well as your Mogl account
    email. We&#39;ll contact you shortly!\n\n\n+ My account is missing a transaction!\n-----------------\nOh
    no! We understand how frustrating this can be, so please understand that we will
    work with you to make sure that we&#39;re doing whatever it takes to get to the
    bottom of the issue! Please read the following information and see if it relates
    to your transaction:\n\n- Cards must be registered before the purchase is made
    in order to be eligible for cash back or rewards.\n- Not all credit cards are
    accepted at every participating business, so please review the business&#39; profile
    page before swiping your card!\n- Third party ordering services such as Grubhub,
    Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Square, etc. are not eligible for cash back or promotions.
    If you have any doubt, please contact the business to make sure that your order
    will be processed through their credit card machine in the business.\n- Businesses
    on the program are always changing, so make sure to check that the business is
    still participating.\n- You need to run all transactions as credit even when using
    your debit card. If you are entering your pin, we will not be able to track the
    transaction.\n- Most businesses participate in &quot;click-to-activate offers&quot;.
    This means you need to click on the offer in order to activate it before each
    purchase. Please make sure to look at the offer beforehand to ensure you receive
    your cash back!\n\nIn the event that your transaction does not fall under any
    of these circumstances, please note that some earnings can take 3-5 days from
    the date of purchase to show up on the site. This time delay can be due to business
    running their credit card reports at different points during the week.\n\nIf you
    do not see your purchase within 5 days of the transaction, please [email us](http://www.cashbackhelp.com/customer/portal/emails/new)
    about all purchases you made that didn&#39;t get credited to your account. If
    the transaction occurred more than 60 days before contacting us, then we will
    not be able to credit your account so please make sure to contact us as soon as
    you realize something is wrong. It&#39;s important to have a receipt or processing
    information from the business to ensure a registered card was used as well as
    your Mogl account email. We&#39;ll contact you shortly!\n\n\n+ How &amp; when
    do I get paid?\n-----------------\nGreat question! First, make sure your primary
    card is updated to reflect your most recent and up to date credit card. Next,
    make sure that you&#39;ve earned over $10.00 in your account. Once you have an
    updated primary card and over $10.00 in your account, the money will be deposited
    back onto your card around the 20th of the following month. (i.e.: Your total
    May earnings will be deposited onto your card around June 20th).\n\n**What&#39;s
    the difference between cash back, cash rewards, and jackpot earnings?**\n- **Cash
    back:** This is the money you earn when you use your card at a participating business.
    Example: Eric&#39;s Pizza is offering 10% cash back. When you activate the offer
    and then use your registered credit/debit card at Eric&#39;s Pizza, 10% of your
    subtotaled bill will be credited back to your account balance.\n- **Cash Rewards:**
    When you email [support@mogl.com](mailto:support@mogl.com) due to a transaction
    issue, the money that the support department issues to your account will show
    up in your account balance. This money is given manually by the amazing support
    team! **It is also important to note that all other types of earnings (jackpot
    and promotional earnings) will show up in your cash reward thermometer.** The
    only money that does not show up in your cash rewards thermometer is the cash
    back you earn automatically.\n- **Jackpot Earnings:** If you are one of the top
    spenders at a participating business (make sure to check their page to see if
    they&#39;re offering a jackpot) by the 8th of the following month, you will earn
    the jackpot prize! The different jackpots can range from $1.00 to $30.00, so make
    sure to check the profile page to see how much you can earn!\n\nSome more important
    information:\n\n- Once you reach a $10 account balance, you are eligible for a
    monthly payment. Payments submitted to the primary card on file on the 8th of
    the month and usually take 2 weeks to process.\n- If you received an email indicating
    a payment, please check your bank statement around the 20th of that month.\n-
    **Cancelled Cards** : If the card you have on file was cancelled, please contact
    us as the payment may have failed to be completed and we will work with you on
    getting this resolved.\n- If your account is completely closed, please contact
    your former bank.\n\n\n+ Ineligible transaction - fulfilled by another program.\n-----------------\nWhile
    some businesses participate in multiple rewards programs, customers are only eligible
    to earn rewards through one program a business uses. Although you may have received
    a cash back notification, the cash back dropped from your account because it was
    blocked by another rewards program linked to the card you used.\n\nIn order to
    start receiving cash back through Mogl again (cash back directly on your card,
    rather than miles or points), add another card that is not linked to any other
    program, or  **remove your card**  from other rewards programs:\n\n- [AA Advantage](https://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/faqs.htm)\n-

    in other rewards programs or you are running into any other issues, please email
    **support@mogl.com**  for assistance.\n\n\n+ Click-to-Activate Offers\n-----------------\nMost
    businesses are now participating in what we call click-to-activate or CTA offers.
    This means that you as a user need to activate the offer on the businesses profile
    page before each separate transaction in order to ensure you receive the cash
    back reward. The great thing about these new offers is that we reward our engaged
    users by offering higher cash back percentages!\n\nIf you activated the offer
    and then made your purchase at a participating business but did not receive your
    cash back notification, please contact our Customer Support team at [support@mogl.com](mailto:support@mogl.com).
    We will look into this matter and get things resolved for you!\n\n\n+ I&#39;m
    new to this program, is there anything I should know?\n-----------------\nThough
    we recommend that you read all of the FAQ&#39;s, here are some of the main things
    you should know:\n\n- Not all credit cards are accepted at every participating
    business, so please review the business&#39; profile page before swiping your
    card!\n- You need to earn a total of $10.00 (between your cash back and cash reward
    thermometer) to get the deposit back onto your primary card!\n- Third party ordering
    services such as Grubhub, Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Square, etc. are not eligible
    for cash back or promotions. If you have any doubt, please contact the business
    to make sure that your order will be processed through their credit card machine
    in the business.\n- Tip is not included in the transaction amount.\n- Cards must
    be registered before the purchase is made in order to be eligible for cash back
    or rewards.\n- Businesses on the program are always changing, so make sure to
    check what new businesses we&#39;ve added near you!\n- You need to run all transactions
    as credit even when using your debit card. If you are entering your pin, we will
    not be able to track the transaction.\n- Most businesses participate in &quot;click-to-activate
    offers&quot;. This means you need to click on the offer in order to activate it
    before each purchase. Please make sure to look at the offer beforehand to ensure
    you receive your cash back!\n- If a missing transaction occurred more than 60
    days before contacting us, then we will not be able to credit your account so
    please make sure to contact us as soon as you realize something is wrong.\n\n\n+
    Is your site secure?\n-----------------\nWe know giving out personal information
    and credit card numbers makes everyone uneasy. Recognizing this, we&#39;ve implemented
    bank level encryption to secure your log in credentials, which cannot be compromised.
    These include:\n\n- VeriSign® certified (Internet Security Global Leader)\n- Visa®
    certified third-party processor (TPP)\n- American Express® Certified end-point
    processor\n- Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant\n- 128-bit SSL encryption\n-
    Secure user password authentication\n- MD5 encryption for card protection\n\nPlus,
    as a general policy\n- Consumers can choose to remain completely anonymous\n-
    Your information will never be shared\n\n\n+ Why do you need my card details?\n-----------------\nFirst
    off, we use bank level encryption to secure that your log in credentials cannot
    be compromised.\n\nBy securely registering your debit or credit cards with us,
    we are able to track your transactions at our participating businesses. We do
    this in association with Visa, Master Card, and American Express. After the transaction
    occurs, the card provider notifies us of the purchase amount, and we credit your
    account with the cash back.\n\nWe only have the ability to credit money to your
    account, not take money out of it. We&#39;re givers, not takers.\n\n\n+ I forgot
    my password!\n-----------------\nGo to this link: [https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password](https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password)
    and type in your login email address. You will receive an email with instructions
    to reset your password within 15 minutes. The email will be from noreply@ymail.mogl.com.
    Please make sure to check your junk/spam folders if you don&#39;t receive the
    email!\n\nIn the event that you are locked out of your account, please wait up
    to two hours before trying to log back in.\n\n\n+ How do I change my email address?\n-----------------\nChanging
    your email address on Mogl is super easy! Go to your profile settings here: [https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings).
    Select **My Account** on the left-hand side of the page, scroll down to where
    it says **Change Emai** l and enter your updated email address.\n\n\n+ How do
    I add a credit card?\n-----------------\nTo add a credit card to your Mogl account,
    please go to your **Settings** here: [https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings)\n\nScroll
    down and click **Cards** on the left-hand side of the page. Once you&#39;re on
    the **Cards** page, scroll down until you see **Link New Card**. Go ahead and
    type out your card number into the box.\n\nYou will be able to earn cash back
    on any card that is registered with Mogl, but you will need to designate a primary
    card. This primary card will be used to credit your bank account when you have
    earned a Mogl payday.\n\n​Also, please keep in mind that all businesses do not
    accept every credit card for Mogl purchases. To ensure you have a great Mogl experience,
    please check the business&#39; profile page to see if your card is accepted! Visa
    is accepted at all Mogl locations.\n\n\n+ How many Debit/Credit Cards can I sign
    up?\n-----------------\nWe like your thinking!  You want to register all your
    cards to make sure you don&#39;t miss out on any earnings, are we right?! So,
    go ahead and register as many as you like, we have no limit!\n\n\n+ How do I unsubscribe
    from your emails?\n-----------------\nDrowning in too many emails? We&#39;re sorry
    to hear that! In order to unsubscribe from Mogl emails, follow the steps below:\n\n1.
    Login to your Mogl profile and go to the top right corner of the page.\n2. From
    the drop-down menu, click **Settings**.\n3. Click **Notifications** on the left-hand
    side of the page and scroll down until you see **Email Settings**. Uncheck the
    boxes for the emails you would not like to receive.\n4. Click **Save Changes**.\n\n**or**
    email support@mogl.com and ask to be unsubscribed or your account deactivated.\n\n\n+
    What happens if my credit card expires or gets canceled?\n-----------------\nEven
    if it has a different expiration number, we will still be able to track your purchases
    but you should delete the card and add it again if it is your primary card to
    ensure we have no issues completing a payment.\n\nHere&#39;s what you do if your
    new card has a new number or is your primary card:\n\n1. Login to your account
    and click **Settings**\n2. Midway down the page you&#39;ll see **Credit Cards
    &amp; Debit Cards**\n3. Click **Delete Card**\n4. Add an additional card by clicking
    **Add a Card**\n\nIf you need to change the card on which you want to be paid,
    this can be adjusted in your **Payment Preferences**. Just select your new card
    under &quot;Pay me on this card&quot;\n\nYour new card must be registered in order
    to receive cash back rewards before the purchase is made.\n"
