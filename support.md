  custom_markdown: "What is a Card Linked Offers Program?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nA
    Card Linked Offers Program is a discreet rewards program that gives you cash back
    at your favorite businesses. All you have to do is link your credit/debit card,
    choose your favorite location on the program, activate the offer and enjoy! Due
    to our official partnership with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, your
    cash reward is credited automatically back to your card. No hassling with coupons
    or loyalty cards; it is for everyone!\n\n\\+ Is the program free? Does it cost
    anything?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nThis program is totally free! Members will
    never be charged anything to participate. In fact, we only have the ability to
    credit money to your account, not take money out of it!\n\n\\+ How do I join?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nWhat?!
    You&#39;re saying you aren&#39;t a member of the Mogl family yet? Well don&#39;t
    you worry because joining Mogl only takes a minute!\n\n1\\. Go to www.mogl.com
    or download our mobile app available on both Android and iOS.\n\n2\\. Create a
    username and password.\n\n3\\. Add your credit/debit card and tada!! You&#39;re
    an official Mogl&#39;er!\n\n4\\. Find participating businesses near you and start
    earning your cash back!\n\n\\+ How much cash back can I get?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nBusinesses
    can give you as much cash back as they desire but most are limited at $250 per
    transaction. Make sure that you&#39;re using a card that&#39;s accepted at the
    business! Double check the accepted cards at the bottom of the business&#39; profile
    page.\n\nTo see how much cash back is being given at a particular location during
    the time of your visit, please check the business&#39; page on our site or app
    and then activate that offer.\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\n\\- You&#39;ll ALWAYS
    earn cash back, just the amount will vary\n\n\\- The BEST offers are listed FIRST
    in the app and website\n\n\\- The cash back is based off of your subtotaled bill
    before tip\n\n\\+ Can I order through a delivery service or order online?\n\n\\-----------------\n\n\\**ANY**
    third-party ordering services and delivery companies **(for example: Square, Grubhub,
    Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Clover, Postmates etc.)** are not eligible for cash back
    or promotions. The purchase must be made through the business&#39; credit card
    machine.\n\nIf you are ordering at a participating business online, please note
    that most use  **external ** resources to facilitate the online ordering. If you
    are entering your credit/debit card online, please call the business to make sure
    that they run their online orders through their credit card machine. If they do
    not run them through the credit card machine, you will not receive cash back or
    cash rewards.\n\n\\+ What is my &quot;Primary&quot; Card?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nThe
    primary card is the card where you will receive the cash back and cash reward
    payout. You will receive this payment around the 20th monthly (as long as you&#39;ve
    reached the $10 minimum in the previous month).\n\n\\**Can I only earn cash back
    on my primary card?**\n\nNo way! Any card that you register on the program will
    earn you cash back at a participating business. All you have to do is use your
    card as credit!\n\n\\**So, what is the difference between my primary card and
    my other cards?**\n\nWe&#39;re glad you asked! Any card registered on the program
    can help you receive cash back at participating businesses. However, only your
    primary card can receive the monthly deposits. So as long as your primary card
    is an active credit card, you&#39;ll successfully receive your payouts!\n\n\\+
    Where can I view my cash back history?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nWe like to see
    users taking advantage of all of their resources, so we&#39;re glad you asked!\n\nGo
    to your **Profile** in the top right-hand side of the page and click to the drop-down
    menu. On the main page you&#39;ll see **Cash Back** underneath to the left-hand
    side of your name. Click on that and you&#39;ll see the cash back history pop
    up. If you can&#39;t scroll through the entire history, simply use your up and
    down arrows to navigate.\n\nIf you notice you&#39;re missing a transaction, don&#39;t
    worry! Simply email our awesome Customer Support team at support@mogl.com with
    your receipt and your account email address.\n\n\\+ How long does it take for
    a purchase to show up?\n\n\\-----------------\n\n\\**We know how excited you are
    to get your cash back, so we do our best to have transactions show up as soon
    as possible! Earnings may take anywhere from a few minutes to 5 days to show up,
    depending on the type of card used and business visited.**  \n\n\\**Most Visa
    transactions come through within 10 minutes after purchase is made. Be sure to
    download our Mogl app to get a real time notification of your purchases.**\n\n\\**Amex
    and MasterCard transactions can take up to 3-5 days to show up.**\n\nOn a rare
    occasion, earnings may not show up in your Mogl account. First, check out the
    payment methods on the business profile page to make sure the type of card (Amex,
    Visa, MC) you used is supported by the business. If it is accepted and it&#39;s
    been longer than 5 days, please email our amazing support department at support@mogl.com
    so we can get you the cash back you deserve! Please include your receipt or processing
    information. It&#39;s helpful if you have a receipt or processing information
    from the business as well as your Mogl account email. We&#39;ll contact you shortly!\n\n\\+
    My account is missing a transaction!\n\n\\-----------------\n\nOh no! We understand
    how frustrating this can be, so please understand that we will work with you to
    make sure that we&#39;re doing whatever it takes to get to the bottom of the issue!
    Please read the following information and see if it relates to your transaction:\n\n\\-
    Cards must be registered before the purchase is made in order to be eligible for
    cash back or rewards.\n\n\\- Not all credit cards are accepted at every participating
    business, so please review the business&#39; profile page before swiping your
    card!\n\n\\- Third party ordering services such as Grubhub, Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon,
    Square, etc. are not eligible for cash back or promotions. If you have any doubt,
    please contact the business to make sure that your order will be processed through
    their credit card machine in the business.\n\n\\- Businesses on the program are
    always changing, so make sure to check that the business is still participating.\n\n\\-
    You need to run all transactions as credit even when using your debit card. If
    you are entering your pin, we will not be able to track the transaction.\n\n\\-
    Most businesses participate in &quot;click-to-activate offers&quot;. This means
    you need to click on the offer in order to activate it before each purchase. Please
    make sure to look at the offer beforehand to ensure you receive your cash back!\n\nIn
    the event that your transaction does not fall under any of these circumstances,
    please note that some earnings can take 3-5 days from the date of purchase to
    show up on the site. This time delay can be due to business running their credit
    card reports at different points during the week.\n\nIf you do not see your purchase
    within 5 days of the transaction, please \\[email us\\]([http://www.cashbackhelp.com/customer/portal/emails/new](http://www.cashbackhelp.com/customer/portal/emails/new
    \"http://www.cashbackhelp.com/customer/portal/emails/new\")) about all purchases
    you made that didn&#39;t get credited to your account. If the transaction occurred
    more than 60 days before contacting us, then we will not be able to credit your
    account so please make sure to contact us as soon as you realize something is
    wrong. It&#39;s important to have a receipt or processing information from the
    business to ensure a registered card was used as well as your Mogl account email.
    We&#39;ll contact you shortly!\n\n\\+ How &amp; when do I get paid?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nGreat
    question! First, make sure your primary card is updated to reflect your most recent
    and up to date credit card. Next, make sure that you&#39;ve earned over $10.00
    in your account. Once you have an updated primary card and over $10.00 in your
    account, the money will be deposited back onto your card around the 20th of the
    following month. (i.e.: Your total May earnings will be deposited onto your card
    around June 20th).\n\n\\**What&#39;s the difference between cash back, cash rewards,
    and jackpot earnings?**\n\n\\- **Cash back:** This is the money you earn when
    you use your card at a participating business. Example: Eric&#39;s Pizza is offering
    10% cash back. When you activate the offer and then use your registered credit/debit
    card at Eric&#39;s Pizza, 10% of your subtotaled bill will be credited back to
    your account balance.\n\n\\- **Cash Rewards:** When you email \\[support@mogl.com\\](mailto:support@mogl.com)
    due to a transaction issue, the money that the support department issues to your
    account will show up in your account balance. This money is given manually by
    the amazing support team! **It is also important to note that all other types
    of earnings (jackpot and promotional earnings) will show up in your cash reward
    thermometer.** The only money that does not show up in your cash rewards thermometer
    is the cash back you earn automatically.\n\n\\- **Jackpot Earnings:** If you are
    one of the top spenders at a participating business (make sure to check their
    page to see if they&#39;re offering a jackpot) by the 8th of the following month,
    you will earn the jackpot prize! The different jackpots can range from $1.00 to
    $30.00, so make sure to check the profile page to see how much you can earn!\n\nSome
    more important information:\n\n\\- Once you reach a $10 account balance, you are
    eligible for a monthly payment. Payments submitted to the primary card on file
    on the 8th of the month and usually take 2 weeks to process.\n\n\\- If you received
    an email indicating a payment, please check your bank statement around the 20th
    of that month.\n\n\\- **Cancelled Cards** : If the card you have on file was cancelled,
    please contact us as the payment may have failed to be completed and we will work
    with you on getting this resolved.\n\n\\- If your account is completely closed,
    please contact your former bank.\n\n\\+ Ineligible transaction - fulfilled by
    another program.\n\n\\-----------------\n\nWhile some businesses participate in
    multiple rewards programs, customers are only eligible to earn rewards through
    one program a business uses. Although you may have received a cash back notification,
    the cash back dropped from your account because it was blocked by another rewards
    program linked to the card you used.\n\nIn order to start receiving cash back
    through Mogl again (cash back directly on your card, rather than miles or points),
    add another card that is not linked to any other program, or  **remove your card**
    \ from other rewards programs:\n\n\\- \\[AA Advantage\\]([https://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/faqs.htm](https://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/faqs.htm

    other rewards programs or you are running into any other issues, please email
    **support@mogl.com**  for assistance.\n\n\\+ Click-to-Activate Offers\n\n\\-----------------\n\nMost
    businesses are now participating in what we call click-to-activate or CTA offers.
    This means that you as a user need to activate the offer on the businesses profile
    page before each separate transaction in order to ensure you receive the cash
    back reward. The great thing about these new offers is that we reward our engaged
    users by offering higher cash back percentages!\n\nIf you activated the offer
    and then made your purchase at a participating business but did not receive your
    cash back notification, please contact our Customer Support team at \\[support@mogl.com\\](mailto:support@mogl.com).
    We will look into this matter and get things resolved for you!\n\n\\+ I&#39;m
    new to this program, is there anything I should know?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nThough
    we recommend that you read all of the FAQ&#39;s, here are some of the main things
    you should know:\n\n\\- Not all credit cards are accepted at every participating
    business, so please review the business&#39; profile page before swiping your
    card!\n\n\\- You need to earn a total of $10.00 (between your cash back and cash
    reward thermometer) to get the deposit back onto your primary card!\n\n\\- Third
    party ordering services such as Grubhub, Eat24, ChowNow, Groupon, Square, etc.
    are not eligible for cash back or promotions. If you have any doubt, please contact
    the business to make sure that your order will be processed through their credit
    card machine in the business.\n\n\\- Tip is not included in the transaction amount.\n\n\\-
    Cards must be registered before the purchase is made in order to be eligible for
    cash back or rewards.\n\n\\- Businesses on the program are always changing, so
    make sure to check what new businesses we&#39;ve added near you!\n\n\\- You need
    to run all transactions as credit even when using your debit card. If you are
    entering your pin, we will not be able to track the transaction.\n\n\\- Most businesses
    participate in &quot;click-to-activate offers&quot;. This means you need to click
    on the offer in order to activate it before each purchase. Please make sure to
    look at the offer beforehand to ensure you receive your cash back!\n\n\\- If a
    missing transaction occurred more than 60 days before contacting us, then we will
    not be able to credit your account so please make sure to contact us as soon as
    you realize something is wrong.\n\n\\+ Is your site secure?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nWe
    know giving out personal information and credit card numbers makes everyone uneasy.
    Recognizing this, we&#39;ve implemented bank level encryption to secure your log
    in credentials, which cannot be compromised. These include:\n\n\\- VeriSignÂ® certified
    (Internet Security Global Leader)\n\n\\- VisaÂ® certified third-party processor
    (TPP)\n\n\\- American ExpressÂ® Certified end-point processor\n\n\\- Payment Card
    Industry (PCI) compliant\n\n\\- 128-bit SSL encryption\n\n\\- Secure user password
    authentication\n\n\\- MD5 encryption for card protection\n\nPlus, as a general
    policy\n\n\\- Consumers can choose to remain completely anonymous\n\n\\- Your
    information will never be shared\n\n\\+ Why do you need my card details?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nFirst
    off, we use bank level encryption to secure that your log in credentials cannot
    be compromised.\n\nBy securely registering your debit or credit cards with us,
    we are able to track your transactions at our participating businesses. We do
    this in association with Visa, Master Card, and American Express. After the transaction
    occurs, the card provider notifies us of the purchase amount, and we credit your
    account with the cash back.\n\nWe only have the ability to credit money to your
    account, not take money out of it. We&#39;re givers, not takers.\n\n\\+ I forgot
    my password!\n\n\\-----------------\n\nGo to this link: \\[[https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password](https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password

    \"https://www.mogl.com/forgot/password\")) and type in your login email address.
    You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password within 15 minutes.
    The email will be from noreply@ymail.mogl.com. Please make sure to check your
    junk/spam folders if you don&#39;t receive the email!\n\nIn the event that you
    are locked out of your account, please wait up to two hours before trying to log
    back in.\n\n\\+ How do I change my email address?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nChanging
    your email address on Mogl is super easy! Go to your profile settings here: \\[[https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings
    \"https://www.mogl.com/u/settings\")\\]([https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings
    \"https://www.mogl.com/u/settings\")). Select **My Account** on the left-hand
    side of the page, scroll down to where it says **Change Emai** l and enter your
    updated email address.\n\n\\+ How do I add a credit card?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nTo
    add a credit card to your Mogl account, please go to your **Settings** here: \\[[https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings
    \"https://www.mogl.com/u/settings\")\\]([https://www.mogl.com/u/settings](https://www.mogl.com/u/settings
    \"https://www.mogl.com/u/settings\"))\n\nScroll down and click **Cards** on the
    left-hand side of the page. Once you&#39;re on the **Cards** page, scroll down
    until you see **Link New Card**. Go ahead and type out your card number into the
    box.\n\nYou will be able to earn cash back on any card that is registered with
    Mogl, but you will need to designate a primary card. This primary card will be
    used to credit your bank account when you have earned a Mogl payday.\n\nâ€‹Also,
    please keep in mind that all businesses do not accept every credit card for Mogl
    purchases. To ensure you have a great Mogl experience, please check the business&#39;
    profile page to see if your card is accepted! Visa is accepted at all Mogl locations.\n\n\\+
    How many Debit/Credit Cards can I sign up?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nWe like your
    thinking!  You want to register all your cards to make sure you don&#39;t miss
    out on any earnings, are we right?! So, go ahead and register as many as you like,
    we have no limit!\n\n\\+ How do I unsubscribe from your emails?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nDrowning
    in too many emails? We&#39;re sorry to hear that! In order to unsubscribe from
    Mogl emails, follow the steps below:\n\n1\\. Login to your Mogl profile and go
    to the top right corner of the page.\n\n2\\. From the drop-down menu, click **Settings**.\n\n3\\.
    Click **Notifications** on the left-hand side of the page and scroll down until
    you see **Email Settings**. Uncheck the boxes for the emails you would not like
    to receive.\n\n4\\. Click **Save Changes**.\n\n\\**or** email support@mogl.com
    and ask to be unsubscribed or your account deactivated.\n\n\\+ What happens if
    my credit card expires or gets canceled?\n\n\\-----------------\n\nEven if it
    has a different expiration number, we will still be able to track your purchases
    but you should delete the card and add it again if it is your primary card to
    ensure we have no issues completing a payment.\n\nHere&#39;s what you do if your
    new card has a new number or is your primary card:\n\n1\\. Login to your account
    and click **Settings**\n\n2\\. Midway down the page you&#39;ll see **Credit Cards
    &amp; Debit Cards**\n\n3\\. Click **Delete Card**\n\n4\\. Add an additional card
    by clicking **Add a Card**\n\nIf you need to change the card on which you want
    to be paid, this can be adjusted in your **Payment Preferences**. Just select
    your new card under &quot;Pay me on this card&quot;\n\nYour new card must be registered
    in order to receive cash back rewards before the purchase is made."
