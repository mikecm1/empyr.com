heading: Our Mission– To Make Earning Rewards On In-Store Purchases as Effortless
  as Breathing
description: Empyr's technology makes earning rewards on in-store purchases so easy,
  sometimes it happens without you even thinking about it, kinda like breathing.  We
  used this mission to build out the Empyr API, which powers online-to-offline (O2O)
  card linked marketing programs for some of the world’s largest websites and apps.
  Direct integration with the three leading credit card associations make it possible
  for online consumers to automatically earn rewards at offline merchants by simply
  paying with linked debit or credit cards, while simultaneously generating revenue
  for online publishers and providing online to offline attribution to advertisers.
  Empyr’s growing network of publisher partners includes Yelp, Microsoft, LivingSocial,
  Coupons.com, Swagbucks and over 1,500 other websites and apps.
